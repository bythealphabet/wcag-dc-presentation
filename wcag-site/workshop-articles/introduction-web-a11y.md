# What is Accessibility 

A Wikipedia search will say : 
Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities.

But a better way to put it is Accessibility ensures that "all" people regardless of there ability, can interact with products, devices, services, vehicles or the environments.

If we look to Accessibility thru the Dotcontrol lens, it will mean that everybody even people with disabilities can use, and contribute to the Web.

# Living life with Disabilities

Types of disabilities are :

- Vision
- Movement
- Thinking
- Remembering
- Learning
- Communicating
- Hearing
- Mental Health
- Social relationships

A person can have a disability for a short period of time, but also it can be so that someone has to live with a disability for the rest of it's life.

A person can have more than 1 disability, but also 2 people with the same disability can experience the affects in a different way.

# The Costs of an inaccessible web  

Even tho society in some way has separated people with disabilities from what we call normal. 
we should be aware of the costs of an inaccessible web can have on our self even if we do not have a disability. We can maybe have a relative that does have a disability, or maybe our grandparents, they maybe want to pay a bill, or get some information about a medication.
or maybe we can be disabled our self for some short period of time. It can make that someone with a very bright mind lose opportunities, like Work, or Educational. Or the can be simply left out of crucial information needed to save lives. (remember Covid19) 


# Reasons (Benefits of having an Accessible Web )

- Civil Rights, We should honor everyone regardless of there abilities.
- Legal issues, the main reason website owners should make sure that accessibility is an important part on there website.
- Bringing in more Business, a simple example would be if you have a good web shop that is robust and accessible, now you will get people with disability also being able to buy or consume what ever you have to offer on your site.  
- Pride in your craft. as a web developer, content creator or designer. (there will be someone thankful for your efforts)

# Ways we we use the Web
Everybody is deferent, and each one of us have deferent needs. Most of us like to use the web with our beloved mouse, but there are people that are using the web with a keyboard only. 
or even with "Single Switch", a Head wand or Mouth Stick. We also know about the screen readers. 

it used to be so that for people with disabilities developers create a separate part on the app, know as off screen interactions. that if you want to use the app with keyboard only or with a screen reader. this would be detected and then shown to the user. 
but these days are gone, we should aim on creating web accessible applications that do not separate of track people with disabilities.  they should be able to use or interact with what everybody is interacting with. while using assistive technologies.

People with disabilities have made it loud and clear that they do not want to be tracked on the internet. The fear is they will be shut out of apps that could be made accessible, and instead forced to use low-quality text versions that lack features and aren’t well maintained. Marco Zehe put it well when he said:

“Letting a website know you’re using a screen reader means running around the web waving a red flag that shouts ‘here, I’m visually impaired or blind!’ at anyone who is willing to look.”

It would take away the one place where blind people can navigate around relatively undetected. That feedback should be respected.

### Overlapping Areas

**SEO:**
having a well semantically structured website would make it easier for search engines web crawlers or spiders to crawl your site.
