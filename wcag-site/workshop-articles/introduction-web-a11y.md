# What is Accessibility

**Definition:** According to Wikipedia, accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments to be usable by people with disabilities. A more inclusive definition is that accessibility ensures *all* people, regardless of their abilities, can interact with products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments.

In the context of Dotcontrol, accessibility means ensuring that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use and contribute to the Web.

# Living Life with Disabilities

Disabilities can vary and include:

- Vision
- Movement
- Thinking
- Remembering
- Learning
- Communicating
- Hearing
- Mental Health
- Social Relationships

Disabilities can be temporary or lifelong. People may have more than one disability, and individuals with the same disability can experience it differently.

### (Research Note)
Conduct research on disability statistics in Cura√ßao, the Netherlands, and Europe to provide specific insights.

# The Costs of an Inaccessible Web

Society often overlooks people with disabilities, but the costs of an inaccessible web are significant for everyone. Consider the impact on individuals who may not have disabilities themselves but are connected to someone who does. Inaccessible websites can hinder opportunities in employment, education, and access to vital information (e.g., during the Covid-19 pandemic).

# Benefits of an Accessible Web

- **Civil Rights:** Recognizing and honoring the rights of all individuals, regardless of abilities.
- **Legal Compliance:** Many regions have laws mandating web accessibility, making it a legal requirement for website owners.
- **Business Advantages:** Accessible websites can attract a broader audience, including people with disabilities, enhancing business potential.
- **Professional Pride:** Web developers, content creators, and designers can take pride in creating inclusive and accessible web experiences.

# Diverse Ways of Web Interaction

Users interact with the web in various ways. Some prefer traditional methods like a mouse, while others rely on alternative interfaces such as keyboards, single switches, head wands, or mouth sticks. Screen readers are also commonly used.

The approach to web accessibility is evolving. Instead of creating separate, off-screen interactions for users with disabilities, the goal is now to develop universally accessible applications. This inclusive design allows users with disabilities to engage with the same content as everyone else, using assistive technologies.

**Privacy Concerns:**
People with disabilities have expressed concerns about being tracked online. The fear is that marking out users of assistive technologies could lead to segregated, lower-quality web experiences. Marco Zehe, an accessibility engineer and advocate at Mozilla, emphasizes the importance of anonymous web navigation for blind and visually impaired users.

### Overlapping Areas

**SEO Benefits:**
Websites with good semantic structure are more easily crawled by search engine bots, improving SEO.

**Web Performance:**
Faster loading pages not only make the website more "accessible" for people in remote areas but also enhance the experience for screen reader users. A slow or unresponsive website can significantly degrade the user experience for those relying on screen readers. For a practical understanding, watch this video demonstrating a screen reader navigating CNN's page: [Screen Reader Demo on CNN](https://youtu.be/EnmWUj4XKGg)

**Security:**
Inaccessible user interfaces can be a security issue. Think of a blind person not being able to log into a form or use an ATM without help. It would be an insecure practice to have to share your PIN or other personal details with someone else. When we make user interfaces accessible to people with disabilities, we don't force them to make a choice between access and security.

**Customer & Business Growth:**
The more accessible your site is, the more customers you could have! The more accessible your app is, the more contracts you could win that have accessibility as a requirement (e.g. government procurement, education software, banking software, etc.).

Accessibility is often left out of a Minimum Viable Product which has the unfortunate effect of blocking people with disabilities from being early adopters. It's a real shame, since accessibility is easiest when you start from the beginning and don't immediately accrue design and development debt.

User research with people with disabilities could highlight product opportunities and new customer segments that your organization would otherwise miss. Don't sleep on accessibility as part of your MVP!
